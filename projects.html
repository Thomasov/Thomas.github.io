          <h2>Endless Runner</h2>
          <p class="help-block">July 2015</p>
          <p>This is an endless runner game I built in Unity 5 by following a tutorial by Jesse Freeman on Lynda.com and then expanding on it. All of the implementation was done in C#. The system was built modularly so that the various components, such as the time manager, object pool, and menu manager, could be reused in other future projects. The artwork is almost exclusively not mine (credit to Jesse Freeman), but I did draw the art for the barrel that sometimes appears as an obstacle and the artwork for the pause screen during a forray I had into pixel art. </p>

          <h2>Auburn Office of Accessibility</h2>
          <p class="help-block">July 2014</p>
          <p>Auburn University's Office of Accessibility C# .NET web application that I wrote early in my career as a web developer. There's not a lot to it, but I'm proud of a lot of the little things in it. It boasts a dynamic system for adding pages that the client can do easily without ever touching any code. They can also manage many other aspects of the site, including but not limited to the number of links on the home page, images in the slideshow, and news articles on the home page. All of this information is stored in an SQL Server database.</p>
