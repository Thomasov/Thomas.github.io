          <p>This is an endless runner game I built in Unity 5 by following a tutorial by Jesse Freeman on Lynda.com and then expanding on it from there. All of the implementation was done in C#. The artwork is  almost totally not mine (credit to Jesse Freeman), but I did draw the art for the barrel that sometimes appears as an obstacle and the artwork for the pause screen. </p>

          <p>Auburn University's Office of Accessibility C# .NET web application that I wrote early in my career as a web developer. There's not a lot to it, but I'm proud of a lot of the little things about it. It boasts a dynamic system for adding pages that the client can do easily without ever touching any code. They can also manage many other aspects of the site, such as number of links on the home page, images in the slideshow, and news articles on the home page. All of this information is stored in an SQL Server database.</p>
